56,,<none>,Malone,FL,USA,"From telephone directories. The ""569"" prefix for Malone, FL was added to the 4-digit telephone numbers there in the mid 1960's, after all numeral-dialling became commonplace. Malone already had dial service for several years, the ""569"" prefix was added to provide incoming direct long distance dialling to the central office. At that time, no other central office was a local call from Malone.",rburke
75,,<none>,Lake City,FL,USA,"Old City Directories, old Florida Almanacs - Lake City, FL never had an EXchange name. It was the last Southern Bell exchange in Florida to convert to dial service, in early 1961. Therefore, the numbers there began with the ""75x"" prefix instead of letters.",rburke
92,,<none>,St Marks,FL,USA,"St Marks, FL never had an exchange name. The ""925"" prefix was not added until about 1966. At that time, no other exchange was a local call from St Marks. Although it was automatic dial, the small exchange had 3-digit phone numbers up until this time !",rburke

Hailey is about 90 miles north of Twin Falls, in central Idaho Sorry I can't give you the EXchange name. Best part of the deal, you didn't really need to dial the full prefix 788. Just the MIDDLE number, 8, -- i.e. 8-xxxx Even in 1975! A five digit switch. Small town fun.",74044.1157

33,FF,(No name assigned),Rome,NY,USA,"This is a bit of historic trivia related to your project. I remember from about 1960 or 61 when our local phone system in Rome NY was upgraded to a 7 digit number like the rest of the world. Before that we had had 4 digits anda letter (2914-R was our home phone) followed by an interim system with six digits. The six digit system was in effect only during a short transition period before the new exchanges were ready. The city of Rome had two exchanges, FF6 and FF7. At the time we were told we were the first exchange in the country that did NOT have a name - only the FF designation - but that this how they would all be in the future. I don't know if this was true or whether we were just one of the early ones, but that is wha",gbrinck
87,,(none),Aspen Hill,MD,USA,"The 871 prefix is too new to have an Exchange name, but I'm going to institute one. The exchange name for the Aspen Hill area of Silver Spring is now TRolley. This is in recognition of the National Capital Trolley Museum which is in our area.",phrebh
546,LH6,(unknown),Port Henry,New York,USA,"In the 1970's LH-6 was still commonly used for the 546 exchange in this small town. I could not think of any words that began with LH so I asked everyone including the New York Telephone business office, repair service and even the operators who staffed the manual cord boards at the toll center in nearby Ticonderoga. No one could ever tell me what LH stood for.",elmercat

30,??,??,PInconning,Michigan,USA,This was for a party line in the rural area of Bay County MI before 1951. Our number was 307F13. It stood for the phone number 307F and the rings for our house - 1 long and 3 short. There were 10 homes on one phone line. This may not fit in with your data but I thought you might find it interesting.,judykay
69,??,??,Teaneck,NJ,USA,"Phone numbers in Teaneck included not only the TE exchange (833, 836, & 837), there were also a lot of people in the town with a 69 exchange (692 only, if I recall correctly.) My recollection is that these numbers were centralized on the south end of town (closest to Bogota and Leonia), but I could never guess what the ""69"" signified. This is all from memory. I grew up in Teaneck during the 1970s and 80s",agoldstein

57,???,???,Scottsboro,AL,USA,"(This is a copy of the message I left in the other section) Scottsboro, Alabama is telephone limbo! I say this because Scottsboro's exchange was 574 -- for which there can be NO NAME! This is not a recent thing, either. As far as I know, the exchange has been 574 as long as Scottsboro has had phone service. I can only guess that Scottsboro got this crumby exchange number because it was served by GTE and/or an obscure predecessor. In any case, it was not (and IS not)SERVED BY Ma Bell. Are there other 5-7 or 7-5 combos? -- BH",bhal1602

27,AR6,?????,Queens,NY,US,"We had the phone number AR6-2971 from the approximately 1963 through July of 1967, when I was almost 7 years old and we moved out. What I DON'T know and am CURIOUS to know is what the ""AR"" was short for, in terms or the entire exchange name. This was the first telephone number that I ever knew! We lived in the Jamaica section of the Borough of Queens (one of the five boroughs of New York City)in a middle-classed co-op apartment building complex called Rochdale Village that was built in approximately 1962, right on the site where the torn-down Jamaica Racetrack was. It had ten buildings, as I recall, and each building had 13 stories. Each building was virtually identical, and it was very confusing and easy to get lost! It's off of New York Boulevard. Rochdale Village had it's own supermarket, shopping center. (including a five and ten store, a barber shop, a candy store, a restaurant, a movie theater, and maybe a few other things that I don't recall) It also had it's own public elementary school; I attended PS (Public School)30. In New York City, all public elementary schools have numbers, not names!!!! I'm pretty sure that it had it's own small post office, and if it didn't, I am sure that it does now. We lived there from 1963 through July of 1967. Rochdale Village is still there; one can still see it while passing it on certain routes of the Long Island Railroad.",gslatz
39,39,396,West Kissimmee,FL,USA,"The West Kissimmee exchange never had an exchange name - it began in 1981 and served the area from Shingle Creek to near Disney World.

45,45,45x,Merritt Island,FL,USA,"The Merritt Island exchange was cut into service in 1966 and never had an exchange name. The original equipment was Western Electric Crossbar 5. Customers there were previously served from the Cocoa office and had NEwton 6, NEwton 2, or 631 numbers (SEE COCOA). A possible exchange name could be GLendale for the 45x prefixes.

The Atlantic exchange covered not only Alhambra, San Gabriel, and Rosemead, it covered Temple City, some parts of northern El Monte, some parts of San Marino, some parts of Arcadia, and the northern part of Monterey Park. The Atlantic exchange in that area was based on the location of the Central Office housing the lines for the homes with those numbers. There were 4 or 5 Atlantic Central Offices and each had 2 or 3 more letters behind the AT for phone company use only to identify which central office handled that number. However, the first number after AT designated which central office it was and could tell you the vicinity of the phone. This was the same for any prefix that handled large areas. Growing up I could tell you the approximate location of any household by the two letters and first digit of any phone number in Los Angeles County. I lived in Temple City with AT7-xxxx as our number. When we lived in the Highland Park part of Los Angeles City our number was CL7-xxxx, which stood for Cleveland, the street the Central Office was on, but my Grandparents in Glendale, L A County, had CLx-xxxx which was Clinton.

28,AT,ATlantic,Tyndall Air Force Base,FL,USA,"The Tyndall Air Force Base exchange was built in 1953, serving the base to the east of Panama City. It was built and operated by the St Joseph Telephone and Telegraph Company, headquartered in nearby Port St Joe. Listings for this exchange first appeared in the April 1954 Panama City telephone directory. Subscribers there were assigned telephone numbers beginning with ""ATlantic 6"" or ""286."" Prior to that time, Tyndall Air Force Base had been served by a private branch exchange. Callers in Panama City accessed the system by dialling ""SUnset 5-4611"" to reach the base operator. The new exchange allowed for the direct dialling to all ""off field"" telephone numbers at Tyndall Air Force Base. These included telephone numbers such as base housing, the base exchange; basically all telephones not assigned to the Air Force Department. The Tyndall exchange was initially ""terminal per line"" in which subscribers were assigned numbers that were ""line specific."" The first three digits of the last four digits of the telephone number were the same for all parties on the same telephone line. The last digit was the ""party digit"" of the customer. To call another party on the same line, callers at Tyndall would dial ""5"" plus their party digit, plus the party digit of the party being called. For example, if the telephone number ""AT 6-6234"" wished to call ""AT 6-6237,"" which was on the same line, they would dial ""547"" and hang up the phone, and allow it to ring. The party line dialling code later changed from ""5"" to ""119."" In later years, the office was upgraded to ""terminal per station"", and party line subscribers could keep their same telephone numbers when they moved. By that time, the exchange name was dropped, and the numbers were written in the all number format. Telephones that were assigned to the Air Force Department initially could not be dialled directly from points outside Tyndall Air Force Base. However from telephones served by the Tyndall exchange, they could. The numbers at ""Tyndall Field"" could be dialled from an ""ATlantic 6"" telephone by dialling ""4"" plus the number in the Tyndall Field telephone directory. Callers from outside Tyndall could reach Tyndall Field by dialling ATlantic 6-2111, which connected to the base operator. In 1968, the ""283"" prefix was added for Air Force Department phones. It was actually used for direct inward dialling to PBX's that were used by the Air Force. The prefixes 283 and 286 continue to be used at the Base today. Recently, the ""282"" prefix has been added.",c_o_historian

Then we cut over to a regular dial phone, hung on the wall in the hall. My parents drilled into me (I was maybe 4 or 5) *never* to play with the dial. I guess the warnings were because bad dialing could result in bills for toll calls, although I think this was before direct-dial long distance was possible. Must have been expensive in any case because not all in our neighborhood had phones, and I clearly remember neighbors coming by asking to use ours. They also drilled our phone number into me, and I'll probably remember that 'AXminster 7' until I die. Later, I remember discovering that the exchange was actually listed as Franklin Park. Whether it was *always* Franklin Park is uncertain because it was some years before my interest led me to that discovery. But in my late teens I met a girl living in Franklin Park whose number differed from mine by 5 in the second-to-the-last digit, so it probably has been there all along.",plav

23,BE,BEVERLY,Rochester,New York,USA,"Suprised you missed this one. Jay Street area. Circa 1965-1967 my mother engrained this number into our psyche - BEverly 5-4605. Ah, and it was a party line. We lived at my grandmother's house. Her phone was made of steel and the fingers of a 10 year old struggled to dial those high digits. Thomas Edison's machinist must have made this one personally. Too bad the phone company made us give it back when my GM died. Don't drop that phone or you would break your toes if not your feet. And who could forget the party lines? 3 parties on this line. If you picked it up enough and clicked it back down enough, the line would clear in about 10 or 15 minutes. I could never imagine my cell-phone connected family surviving a party line :)",genealogy1

27,BR,BRadshaw,Beverly Hills,California,USA,"From what I've heard BRadshaw covered parts of Beverly Hills just as CRestview did. Since the letters are the same, by the time exchanges were no longer used, they must have had non-overlapping number sets, but I'd be surprised if that was true in the beginning. My parents mentioned BRadshaw to me. We had a CRestview number but I don't remember any BRadshaws. About the possible UC prefix, I note with interest that the oldest phone numbers on the UCLA campus all begin with 825, which actually spells out UCL. I don't know if this was just a concidence or if this reference to UCL(A) was intentional.",vanscoyoc

I believe that this exchange was for a part of the city that spanned L.A. and Beverly Hills, and that most BR numbers I encountered seemed to be for businesses, not residences. In checking my phone to write this information, I notice that BR has the same numbers as CRestview, which was definitiely a Bevery Hills exchange.

22,CA,CAlhoun,Tallahassee,FL,USA,"Old telephone number - Tallahassee had an EXchange name only briefly, such a short time that they never appeared in the telephone directory before all digits came into use! I saw the EXchange name in an old telephone number. In 1959, Tallahassee had only one central office and numbers were five digits, 2-xxxx, 3-xxxx, and 4-xxxx. A conversion to 7 digits was planned to receive direct dialled calls. Originally, it was planned to have the name CAlhoun added in front of the five digit numbers. This made sense, the central office was actually on Calhoun Street! However in the December 1960 telephone directory, Tallahassee numbers were listed as seven digits; for example 222-xxxx, 223-xxxx, 224-xxxx. A new central office serving the northern parts of Leon County was cut into service at that same time. This was the ""385"" exchange, and it was also listed as seven digits. About 1962, the ""599"" prefix appeared downtown, and customers could then dial their own long distance calls, by dialling ""112"", plus the ""circle digit"", which was a digit in a circle on the number card on the phone dial. This was to set up billing to the correct party. Party line customers had circle digits from 2 through 9, and private line customers had circle digit 1. To make a long distance call required 14 digits ! 112 + circle digit + area code + 7 digit number. Around 1964, the ""877"" exchange on the east side of town was cut into service, and later in December 1966, the ""576"" exchange on the western side of town began service. The ""223"" prefix was dropped, probably because of the additional ""22x"" phone numbers made available from the new central office cut ins around the county. In 1972, state and county office numbers were changed to the ""488"" prefix. which brought centrex features and direct dialling of extensions to those agencies. Later the ""644"" prefix began service at Florida State University to do the same thing there. In December 1978, the ""893"" office was cut into service, serving the Killearn Estates area and northeast Leon County. This was the first electronic switching system in the city. The next year, nearby Woodville in the southeastern part of the county got ""421"", which was the first digital central office in the county, a Nortel DMS-10. In December 1982, the ""562"" office was cut into service in the Lake Jackson area in the northwest part of the county, completing the present-day central office network in Leon County for Sprint-Centel. None of the offices,except 22x, ever had EXchange names.",rburke

Later, it was shortened to the more streamlined ""CE4-6562"". I remember trying to say it once with only the numbers, this when it was still the fashion to use the appropriate letters and it sounded quite naked to my ears. Too sterile. Too modern. I didn't like it. But what I most recall now is how those old word/letter designations helped me to remember phone numbers much more easily than I have ever been able to do since. My grandparents telephone number was a wonderous mass of 5's and 7's. ATLANTIC 7-5575. A had no trouble at all with ATLANTIC.

257,CL7,CLifford,Lyons,Kansas,USA,"Central Kansas was a strange place in the 1950s and 1960s. Ma Bell was known as Southwestern Bell. There were also a lot of small independents around, too. I grew up in Rice County, which is smack in the middle of Kansas. The county seat and largest town is Lyons (pop 4545 in 1950, 3600 in 2000). Like so many rural towns in Kansas, Lyons is dying, but that is another story. The tale begins in the 1960s when some of the telephone exchanges around Lyons began to convert over to dial. Lyons was still an old operator-ran exchange (well into the 1960s!), but the nearby town of Chase (pop 300) was converted over to dial and used the exchange WE 4 (WElls). Chase was also Southwestern Bell. Soon the exchanges south of Lyons (Sterling and Alden) which at the time were owned by Continental Telephone Company converted over as well. Sterling used BR 8 (BRoadway) and Alden used KE 4 (KEystone). Bushton in the northwest part of the county (owned by the Bushton Tel Co) also converted over before Lyons and used LO 2 (LOwell). Geneseo which was about 10 miles east of Bushton converted over using TA 4 (TAylor). The last telephone exchange in Rice County that was still using a common battery system converted over before Lyons, too. That one was Little River (owned by Mutual Telephone of Little River). The used only the prefix 897 (some have suggested that this would have been TWilight). But I never saw the TW exchange used. Finally just before I went to college in the mid 1960s, Lyons was converted over to standard dial. I believe that it was among the last of any of the Bell system to be switched over. Lyons used the CL 7 (CLifford) exchange and still does to this day. Times have changed for Chase, though. Chase is now 938, WE 4 disappeared when Bell finally implemented direct dial in the Lyons exchange. Today, Sterling and Alden are owned by Sprint. Bushton is owned by H&B Communications and Geneseo is part of the Home Telephone Company of Galva, Kansas. A little bit of trivia from the middle of America. Dennis Young Phoenix, AZ",ej90957

The operator on the ""B"" board (incoming trunks) would look at lights with numbers on them, then plug into the proper jack to get the number the out-of-towner dialed. Mom would come home with a headach after a shift on the ""B"" board. It was one of the last exchanges in NJ to convert. Upon conversion NJ Bell decided to change the name to CLifford 6 to ""better reflect the fact that it covers several towns.""

Prior to dial, it was one to four digits in manual service with a letter following for people with party line service. When the town was cut to dial, 'CLinton 1-xxxx' was announced, and it stayed like that until around 1963-64 when it became '251-xxxx'. Like nearby Independence, 251 was the only exchange in town for many years. Sometime in the middle 1990's, Southwestern Bell also opened a second exchange, 252, which is mostly for a centrex system for the town government, but rarely, you will see an individual residence with a 252 number. A joke used to go like this: Independence with its EDison phone numbers made sense, since Thomas Alva EDison was well known, but at the time of the conversion, Hillary Rodham CLinton was just a little girl.

I'm having a hard time locating a website which is devoted and related to your subject, and it does exist. The site, lets you enter your phone number, and it gives you the different names combinations that follow the numbers, or visa versa, you can type in the name, and it converts it to the tel numbers. ""WOULD YOU KNOW THE SITE ADDRESS< please email me...."" also, I always wanted to find out from MA BELL, why they never included the two letters from the alphabet on the telephones, who ever selected those two in the first place, not to be listed?

29,cy,cypress,anacortes,washington,usa,"My family moved from Wisconsin to Anacortes about 1972. Anacortes was (at that time) a small town located on Fidalgo Island, about 60 miles north of Seattle. When we arrived in the new hometown, I was in third grade. After our phone was connected I was told that our phone number was (206) 293-3648. It turns out that the entire town only had one NNX, 293. The first time I attempted to call one of my new school friends I dialed the regular way, 293-XXXX. But I didn't reach the party I was trying to call. It turns out that because the town only had one exchange, callers only had to dial the ""3"" in 293, and then the line number to reach the correct party. ""Who knew!"" I was only eight years old and wasn't given all the information!! As my family met people in town and I visited other homes I observed the phone number stickers in the middle of the rotary dials indicating CYpress3-XXXX. Finally I asked someone what gives with the CYpress thing? It was then that I was told about the Exchange Name. The town where I was born in Wisconsin had at least two exchanges, that I was aware of, and I never was exposed to Exchange Names prior to moving ""out west."" (My parents house was 423 and Grandma and Grandpa was 424 in Wisconsin Rapids, WI.) In 1989 I started to work for the former GTE (now Verizon) in Everett, WA and was made aware that there was another 293 exchange in one of our serving areas, (406) 293- in Libby, Montana. GTE sold off this exchange perhaps five or so years ago. I worked for GTE/Verizon for 12 years from June 1989 to June 2001 and have just left the company to work for MCI/WorldCom selling data connectivity products. Hope you find this information interesting! Best Regards, Stan Shimkus",sshimkus

33,DEN,DENver,Denver,PA,USA,"Technically not a true named exchange, but nonetheless an interesting story is involved: In the early '90s the 215 area code was split, with the customers furthest from Philadelphia being changed to 610; however, three exchanges were transferred to 717 instead: Adamstown (484), Terre Hill (445) and Denver (267). The Adamstown and Terre Hill customers got to keep the same prefixes; but since 267 had already existed in NPA 717, a new prefix had to be found for the Denver subscribers - and they came up with 336, which just happens to spell out D-E-N! (The reason why these three exchanges probably didn't go to 610 was because they are served by a small independent company, the Denver-Ephrata Telephone Co.; the company's other exchanges were in NPA 717, so they probably did it so that all of the company's customers could have the same area code. A while back, a similar situation existed with the Taconic Telephone Corporation of upstate New York; originally, two of their exchanges - Millerton [789] and Pine Plains [398] were in NPA 914, the rest of their customers [the vast majority] were in 518 [except Hancock, Massachusetts in 413]; then Millerton and Pine Plains were moved to 518).",generationx187

Thus: Albion, Ash, Bellaire, Birch, Clermont, Cherry, DEXTER, Dahlia, Eudora, Elm, Fairfax, Forest...you get the picture.

When we left the farm, it was for Milwaukee, where you could pinpoint the area in which someone lived by his or her telephone exchange. The South Side was home to blue-collar Polish Catholic Democrat families, and featured EVergreen, ORchard, and MItchell telephone exchanges. EVergreen, to the best of my knowledge, was drawn from the many evergreen trees of the area. ORchard street was a residential street I'll tell her you came over."" Mitchell Street, by the way, was named for aviation hero General Billy Mitchell. And that's more than you wanted to know about the South Side, with its stoic, hardworking Polish people, and their neat gardens, and their trim, tight houses and their EVergreen, ORchard and MItchell exchanges, if they had telephones at all.

When I was young, we only dialed the 4 digits (235-2721 would be just 2721), any calls outside of town, like to Mt Shasta, 8 miles away, was done through the local operator, and that exchange building still stands in Dunsmuir (or did last time I was there). BTW, Mt Shasta CA was WAlnut6, if memory serves me (now 926). Later we had to dial the 5 and the four numbers. and finally the entire 7 digit number. The area code at that time was 916, which covered all of northern California, from Sacramento to the boarder. Now only Sacramento is 916 and the remaining area is 530. I would date the change from only dialing 4 digit to 5 at around 1964, and the 7 digits about 1967. Many times we would recognize the operator's voice, although phone company policy prohibited them from identifying themselves--though if we said, ""Hi Ethel"" she would respond, and one would usually catch up on family stuff.",djdewey

At that time, through 1963 the phones were all 'EDison-1-xxxx. Beginning in 1963, telco began assigning them and announcing them as '331'. 331 is still the only phone exchange in this town of 8800 residents, and people quite often give their phone number as just (the last) for digits. Beginning a few years ago, 332 was added; it is a centrex for the City Of Independence government offices, police, etc. *There are also cell phones on 332*. Likewise, 330 was added a few years ago, and is primarily the Montgomery County Sheriff's centrex (330-1000) and there are cell phones also on 330. But if you see a phone in someone's home here, or a store or an office, it will be 331-xxxx",ptownson

When we left the farm, it was for Milwaukee, where you could pinpoint the area in which someone lived by his or her telephone exchange. The South Side was home to blue-collar Polish Catholic Democrat families, and featured EVergreen, ORchard, and MItchell telephone exchanges. EVergreen, to the best of my knowledge, was drawn from the many evergreen trees of the area. ORchard street was a residential street I'll tell her you came over."" Mitchell Street, by the way, was named for aviation hero General Billy Mitchell. And that's more than you wanted to know about the South Side, with its stoic, hardworking Polish people, and their neat gardens, and their trim, tight houses and their EVergreen, ORchard and MItchell exchanges, if they had telephones at all.

390,EX0,EXchange-0,"White Plains,",NY,USA,"35 years switchman. New York Telephone, NYNEX, Bell Atlantic, Verizon, (same job, different Co. names.) I worked XB-1, XBT, #1ess, #1aess, #5essand CARRIER/Frame, //and covered (but not week-end qualified in Panel & XB-5.) -------------------------------------------------------------------- EX-0 (we called it EX-oh) was the Westchester County, NY Area official exchange. Used by many NY Tel and also AT&T back offices (for intra-company, or for test numbers,) and also some for public official use. i.e.> repair was EX-0-6611, later changes to 611. The Business office was EX-0-8811, later to become 811. Now 390 has been freed from its official status for about 20 years, and is just another POTS office in White Plains, NY. Each Exchange also had its own 'official numbers' in this area, it was nnx-99xx. The thousands, hundreds 99 group was full of test, c.o., garage, CBO, RBO, and other lines used by the local telephone forces. In cross-bar days (1970's for me) I worked in Mount Vernon NY Tandems, among other places. The exchange names helped me to remember where the individual trunk groups were terminated on the OGT board (outgoing trunk test.) They must have helped the operators memory also. There is always SO MUCH to remember for a Tel employee.",lord.moon

What was odd is we were only 50 miles from AT&T HQ in Baskin Ridge, N.J. snd it was their back yard. However the exchange name was indeed ExPort 7 = 397 which is still the Exchange and area code (609). Please keep in mind the town of Stockton was two area codes.1/3 of the town was in an older area code (207) The Bell telephone company was located on MAin St. in Lambertville in the 50's and that is where the Bell operators were housed before we had dial phones. I can remeber, but I think in 59 we kids would just say 1250 or 0691. As a matter a fact I do remeber that being the only number in my life there. Many times the operator was my babysitter which was asful because she would know where i was and Mom would find out. Or is Mom and I were arguing about picking me up in hte car, Suzzane ( Babysitter) would not put me through to my mother at 0691 and told me to walk home. Four blocks is all it was anyway.

32,FA,FAirfax,Memphis,TN,USA,"While shopping for an old Western Electric rotary dial phone (which has been a lot of fun to use)I ran across your site. It made me curious about the Memphis area. I read William Kelly's notes in the history section of your site, and his comments about Memphis coming late to the exchange name world helped me to narrow my search. I found old R. L. Polk city directories at the University of Memphis - easy enough. However, I now live in a suburb of Memphis, which, in 1962, was a rural area far, far away from the central offices located in Memphis. None of the Memphis numbers matched my current number, and no rural numbers that far out were listed. In the 1",lisago

32,FA,FAirfax,Spokane,WA,USA,from my collection,nlambert
32,FA,FAirfax,Spokane,Washington,U.S.,"In 1960 I was born in the small town of Omak, WA,(pop. 4000 approx.)which didn't even get dial service until 1963. Before 1963 you had to place all calls, local or long distance through the operator. I don't remember this of course. By the time Omak did get dial service named exchanges were already being phased out. Being as the town was served by the Bell System, (believe it or not) I suppose they were at the forefront of the exchange name phase-out. To try to make this a little shorter & get to the point, my parents and older siblings often travled to Spokane, WA 140 miles from Omak. Spokane's population at that time was probably about the same as now, around 180,000 or so. Spokane I would imagine had had dial service for many years prior to 1963. Again, I seem to be digressing, but I'm getting there. Being the sort of geek that I am, when I was old enough to start using the phone 1966??? Spokane still had the named exchanges in use, as close as I can remember until the early to mid seventies. I always thought the named exchanges were pretty cool, and can still remember all of the ones from Spokane and a few from the Seattle area also. I know I should have worked for the phone company. Alas, it's not the same big, comfortable AT&T/Bell System we grew up with, damned anti-trust laws anyway. Those meddlers in congress just couldn't leave well enough alone and telephone service has gone downhill since. Well, hope this is kind of a unique little story about named exchanges. I would never tell it to any of my friends, so I'm glad I could tell it to you, a fellow phone junkie. My family already know I'm a phone addict and help me in my quest to lead a somewhat normal life. Thanks for letting me share, if you need any assistance in your project, please E-mail. I could go on and on about this, Klondike5, the same as today's generic 555 you hear on the TV. Again this has been fun and I'm glad I stumbled on to this site. Sincerely, Thomas Lockwood",judnruth

3,F,Fairgrounds .,San Francisco,CA,USA,"1940 directory. A non-diallable manual prefix for the Golden Gate International Exposition (1939-40 World's Fair) on Treasure Island, sort of a manual Centrex, it would appear. This was not diallable because there was a special Exposition rate center for the fair which was local to none of the San Francisco or Oakland rate centers and could therefore not be dialled; there was no trans-Bay dialling yet in 1940. The Pan Am Clipper seaplane terminal was Fairgrounds 1200. The terminal was later Naval Station Bldg 1, where I was stationed in 1966-68. The Bell System exhibit was Fairgrounds 1375. And, to round out the sample as it were, one of the most-famous exhibits, the Sally Rand Nude Ranch, was Fairgrounds 1224. In the November 1940 Oakland and Bay Counties directory, there is one white page and one yellow page for Fairgrounds numbers. Fairgrounds looks suspiciously like a toll-collecting scam by Pacific Telephone, because Yerba Buena Island, adjacent to Treasure Island, was in the San Francisco Central rate center 9the Coast Guard base was YUkon 2430. After the fair, when the Navy took over Treasure Island, the island reverted to San Francisco Central; the base operator was EXbrook 3931, later EXbrook 2-3931, later 392-3931, later 765-9111, and finally 395-1000 when the Naval Station was closed recently.",Hugh Hamilton <hamilton

It was the home switch for Portland's new 911 system in the 70's. And, to this day, you can still reach Portland's 911 operators by dialing either 911 or 760-6911. Since all of Portland's prefixes used to begin with a 2 or a 7, and no two prefixes shared a second digit, you could omit the first digit on all local calls when dialing within Portland from a step office.

I remember a wall phone I had to stand on a stepstool to dial (maybe I was 8?), and it was a party line. Later they got a desk model, which they still have, with a 25 foot cord from the wall to the phone! It was great for teenager's ""private"" phone calls, but it was really necessity - my dad was Chief of the Haledon Emergency Ambulance Corps, and the ambulance phones rang in our house. When we were outside, the phones were lowered out the window. There were 3 phones on the desk, 2 ambulance phones (278 something), and our phone. When an ambulance call came in, my dad and/",uncadave

43,HE,HEmlock,Atlanta,GA,USA,"From old telephone Directory, and personal knowledge. The HEmlock exchange was in Midtown Atlanta in the Crescent Avenue central office. It began service August 17, 1917, and was a common battery cordboard. The office existed until it was retired in June 1951, being the last manual office in Atlanta. Existing HEmlock subscribers were given new numbers on the new ELgin office or other offices in the exchange. Between 1931 and 1951, HEmlock co-existed with a step-by-step switch in the same building (see VErnon). Private line customers on the HEmlock exchange had numbers such as ""HEmlock 5046"" (my uncle's old number). Party line customers had a party digit that followed the number. These digits were J,M,R, and W, the number appearing in the format ""HEmlock 2376-W"". Customers calling from a dial exchange to a manual exchange in Atlanta in those days would simply dial the number and the call went through. How ? Upon dialling HE (43), they would be connected to an operator that handled incoming calls to HEmlock. Before the operator was a display of 5 groups of lamps. The lamps would light up corresponding to each digit of the incoming number being dialled. When the caller dialled ""5"", the ""5"" lamp in the first group would light, then when the caller dialled ""0"", the ""0"" lamp in the second group would light. Then the caller dialled ""4"", lighting the ""4"" lamp in the third group, and when ""6"" was dialled, the ""6"" lamp in the fourth group would light. If there was a party letter, the caller would dial it, and the corresponding lamp would light in the fifth group; if not the call was to a private number. The operator then connected the incoming trunk to the line of the corresponding number on the display and rang the phone.

44,HI,HIllcrest,Boulder,Colorado,USA,"Back in the early 60's, the exchange for all of Boulder, Colorado was HIllcrest and most of the numbers were HIllcrest 4-XXXX. Mine was HIllcrest 4-2275, and there was enough flexibility in areas versus exchanges, that this number stayed with me even though I moved around in this University of Colorado college town for a number of years. Most of the Boulderites of that time did not even bother writing down the ""HI"" part of the number, which by that time, had become the personality-free ""44,"" and just wrote down somebody's number as 4-2275, meaning ""444-2275."" About that time, you could be identified as a ""newbie,"" a new arrival to Boulder, if you had the newer exchange ""443-XXXX."" Also about that time all City of Boulder phone numbers became 441-XXXX, but I don't think the ""441-"" exchange is exclusive to the City of Boulder anymore. Of course, that was also when you could drop something in the mail with just ""City"" as part of the address, as in ""Joe Blow, 1619 Pine, City"" and the Post Office knew that was for delivery within the city of Boulder. And, by the way, for you ""Mork and Mindy"" fans, 1619 Pine Street is the house which appeared on that show as Mindy's residence and was a bit of a tourist attraction for quite a while... becoming a moderate-to-severe pain in the tuchas for the dwellers therein. They finally put up a big fence around the home. They said they had people slipping up to the windows to take pictures of the inside of the house during the show's peak period. For a long time I had the number 444-1200, and it turned out that this once had been the number of a major national tire company (J. D. Brewer, I think) and for quite a while I would get calls in the middle of the might from truckers who had blown a tire in the middle of Texas or Oklahoma or wherever, and could I send out a repair truck. It wasn't long before I obtained the new, corrected number for the tire company and would routinely tell the stranded trucker the correct number. It got so I could even recite this number from memory while I was still half asleep. Dick Loesch",dick

48,HU,HUnter.,Montreal.,Quebec.,Canada.,"HUnter Exchange, Notre Dame de Grace, Montreal The First Telephone Exchange in Notre Dame de Grace was at Walkley and Sherbrooke where Meldrum the Mover was in Fifties and Sixties.  The Next Exchange was at the present location on Monkland Ave. just East of Grand Ave. Was originally known as WAlnut and took up only 1/2 of City Block between Hingston and Hampton, with the Entrance at the Hampton Corner. Contained WAlnut and Elwood.  Around 1950, the Central Office was expanded West to Hingston. Three Floors.  I think DExter was Installed then.  The Frame Office was at North East Corner, Number there then was HU-4-1173.  Became HUnter Exchange when 7-digit Dialing Implemented.  Step by Step Numbers in HUnter were; HU-1-4-6-8-9  Cross Bar was HUnter-2.  All Numbers were 483-5-7-0.  I worked at HUnter for 6 Months as a Central Office Man in 1965. Absolutely Fascinating!  In the Basement at the Rear the Cable Vault, where all the Telephone Cables from Subscribers Entered.  The Older Cables were Lead Sheathed, and the 'Wiping' on these Old Cables was immaculate.  Each Cable was Pressurized with Nitrogen Gas to keep Moisture Out, as the 'Pairs' in the Older Cables were Paper-Wrapped.  Gas Meters Monitored the Gas Flow, and if Consumption Increased Dramatically, a Cable Repair Crew was sent out on the Offending Cable.  A sensitive Microphone was aimed at the Cable to detect Hiss of Escaping Gas.  Also in the Cellar was a Gas Tight Room containing 5 Foot Tall Wet Cell Batteries for Operating the Exchange if the Quebec Hydro Failed.  There were also Three 3 GM Diesel Generator Sets in the South East Corner of Basement.  An Ammeter Monitored Current Consumption, and on the Record Day, November 22, 1963, the Equipment Drew 3200 Amps.  On Rainy Days, as Water seeped into Cables, Ammeter rose, and the Sound of 'Ground' could be heard on Telephone Circuits.  They were Three 3 'Dial Tone' Machines which had Several Hollow Mercury-Filled Steel Rotors.  These Rotors had Brushes riding on their Outer Surface providing Electricity to Mercury inside.  Between the Two Mercury Chambers within was an Insulating Diaphragm with Holes Drilled in it, and as Mercury flowed in Contact through Holes as Rotors Revolved, Dial Tone, Busy, Fast-Busy, and Line Out of Service Tones were produced.  The amount and spacing of the Interior Holes governed the Tone the Rotors Produced.  The Frame was on the First Floor, Above the Cable Vault, and ran the full length of the Rear of the Building.  The Test Centre was on Second Floor above Frame.  In the Step by Step Era Most Pay Phones had 00 as First Two Digits, as in; 484-0071.  HUnter 2, Cross Bar, was installed in early Sixties, and took up very little room.  483-5-7-0 were Installed after they went to All Numbers.  To gain access to various Floors, a Notched Round Tubular Key was Issued.  Sloped Equipment Ladders on Wheels, the top running in a Rail on Overhead allowed CO Men access to Equipment to Routine Switches and Connectors.  Selectctor Switches just Routed Call to next Selector.  The Connector made the Connection to Telephone Set. Whe last two Number Dialled, Say, xxx-xx25, the Connector Stepepd Up Five Levels, waited for Last Digit, and Rotated in 2.  The Connector then either Sent a 'Ring' to the Telephone, or a Busy Back to Caller if Line already In Use.  Line Finder Switches were Taken to a Bench for Work.  Loud Gongs were on Pillars that Rang Out various Tones to Alert that a Switch was Stuck, etc.  At 8:00 AM on Week Days, all the Equipment Lunged into Operation as another Business Day Commenced.  The Ammeter noting the surge.",cdnlococo

Putting a half dozen kids down to go to sleep when in just 15 min your going to be hearing KA-BOOM! KA-BOOM!! What child could stay in there beds with That! Any knowing Tinker Bell was flying around and all those great cartoon characters were out there right at that same moment watching the same thing your hanging out the window to watch?

67,OR,John Blair,Glen Cove,New York,USA,"When I missed my school bus home in 1st Grade (Circa 1965) I tried to call home from a public phone in a nearby Luncheonette. All I knew was my number was OR6-xxxx (I belive it was as in ""Oriole"" as I heard people say ""The number is Oriale6, something something something something. There were 2 exchanges in Glen Cove OR6, and OR1. Anyway I kept dialing 0r6 (Zero R 6) and not getting through. I asked the woman in the Luncheonette to help and she said ""Maybe your phone is dead at home"" Needless to say, I was starting to panic now. A five year old, miles from home and not knowing what to do! I dialed the Zero R 6 one more time (The phone, by the way was one of those public phones with the three slots on top, from left to right it took quarters, dimes and nickles. Calls had just gone up to a dime that same year I beleive) When I tried one more time, the operator came on the line! She asked me what was wrong, and I told HER what I was trying to do. SHE figured out what my mistake was, and explained that I needed to dial a 6 for the first ""O"", not a zero. And thenm she connected me for free to home. Ah, simpler times. I bet her name was something like Betty or Mary. Not Shongahesha or Gunitarino. Thanks for letting me have this little vanity trip down memory lane back to good old 1965!",blairware

52,LA,LAckawanna,New York,NY,USA,"I live at the Hotel Times Square on 255 W 43rd St. My family has been in and out of it from 1926 into the 60s. So it interested me to find the correct number, which is LAckawanna 4-6900. According to the Manhattan telephone book 1955, where all the exchanges in use are listed plainly, there is ONLY a LAckawanna 4. That means, no other digit but 4 after the ""LA."" The number comes from the Lackawanna Line, a railroad that was a big player before most of them disintegrated. There is to this day, a Lackawanna sign on the ferry terminal across the Hudson River at 42nd Street. The terminal was closed for a long time, but is in use now. By the way, Times Square was called Longacre Square first. So the proper exhange for that is LOngacre. It is also used only in certain combinations for the third digit. Please see the 1955 Manhattan directory for the entire Metropolitan New York local dialing region. New Jersey numbers are elsewhere. It was on film at the NYPL.",subwaysleuth

47,LA,LAkeview,Chicago,Illinois,USA,"Info came from an elderly neighbor who's a long-time local resident and former Illinois Bell operator. Exchange was named for Lakeview, now a Chicago neighborhood but originally an independent suburb. The exchange covered the lakefront area south of Graceland Cemetery (GRaceland 2) and east of Wrigley Field (WRigley 5). I think GRaceland 2 and LAkeview 5 are both old exchanges since their numbers fit Chicago's earlier 3 letter and the later 2 letter/1 number scheme. The drugstore on the corner by my house has a sign that still shows their number as GRaceland 2--and they keep it freshly painted!",td_phillips

52,LA,LAkewood,Lakewood (Tacoma),WA,US,"My recollection. I grew up in suburban Tacoma, (Pierce County) Washington, in what was then an unincorporated area called Lakewood or Lakewood Center. (Lakewood is now incorporated, a city in itself.) The telephone numbers had the LAkewood prefix. An example would be LA 2995. But, with ""progress,"" Lakewood lost the LA prefix. One of the reasons the telphone company gave was that our Lakewood was being confused with a Lakewood (in Snohomish County) elsewhere in the state. So... we ended up with JUniper prefixes plus the number 8. So, a phone number which used to be LA 2995 became JU 8 2995. ............ Now, a question...I have a chrome metal fingernail clipper. It's about identical to the clippers which can be purchased today, except this is an adverstising promotional item. Engraved on it is: ""Call SHANNON O'NEIL DAVIES CHEVROLET, INC. EA 4200 AD 1239"" ..... I'm trying to find out in what city Davies Chevrolet existed. Using the telephone letter prefixes perhaps this can be done. I've run into a dead end contacting libraries and cities which have Davies Chevrolet. Any help for me on this? Thanks!",timarsh

564,LO,LOwell,delphi,indiana,usa,"I am a former resident of Delphi. The exchange was converted from a Kellogg common battery system to a Kellogg dial system (using, I think, crossbar equipment) approximately 1960, at which time the numbers were converted to 7-digit (LO4-xxxx). For several years, local calls required dialing only the 5 numbers (4-xxxx). Under the old common battery system (which was used for approximately 20 years) there was service for private and party lines. Private lines were numbered from 1 through the lower end of 3-digit numbers. Party lines were (at least in the rural areas) 10-party; the individual phones on a party line were equipped with a ""tuned"" ringer, set to one of 5 different frequencies. The ringers on half (ie 5) of the phones on each party line were hooked between ground and TIP, the other 5 between ground and RING. Thus, each phone on a party line could be rung without ringing any others on the same line. The numbering system for party lines reflected the method the operator used to ring the desired party -- the scheme was Rxx-color where ""R"" was either an 8 or a 9 (indicating whether to ring between TIP and ground or RING and ground -- I don't recall which was which), ""xx"" was a two-digit party-line number and ""color"" indicated the frequency, corresponding to similarly-colored buttons on the switchboard: Blue, Black, White, Red, (I think the 5th color was Green). For example, phones on one party-line might be 824-green, 924-blue, 824-blue, etc. David Peterson",davidp2344

59,LY,LYnwood,Bellefontaine,Ohio,USA,"Basically as a result of my hobby of collecting telephone prefixes from all over the USA and Canada,I have decided to add a few of the ""maverick"" names in the above examples from the pages of the United Telephone Company of Ohio.These would hardly be recommended by Ma Bell but nevertheless were a part of the glorious past. I have all of the USA,Canada,and foreign prefixes listed(handwritten)by city and state(Province).These are listed on notebook paper three columns across. I have 13 pages for Ohio alone,17 for New York state and 23 for California,etc. (US notebook approx.3 inches thick)",nlambert
59,LY,LYnwood,Canton,ME,USA,"from my collection. While checking your list against what I was going to add (so as to avoid duplication) I came across Oakland ME with a HObart exchange,while my records showed HOpkins, and Stockton Springs ME with LOcust as opposed to my records with LOgan. I added both of my entries,so that there will be two entries for each until someone figures out the correct one. Thanks and good luck..",nlambert

When I moved to Coal City my number was Coal City 8261 all incoming and originating calls outside of the of the exchange were operator handled. About 1961 we had our numbers changed by adding MErcury 4 to the original number both before and after the number change we could complete calls within the exchange by dialing only the last 4 digits, this lasted until the Step office was replaced by a Western Electric #3 (analog) Electronic Switching System (ESS)in 1971 or so (the actual telephone number) the first 2 digits identified the exchange and the 3rd was the centeral office in that exchange even though these ""Steppers"" only had one central office. Coal City and all the of the above named CO's with the exception of Ottawa, Morris, and the 725 prefix in Joliet were Step-by-Step (SXS) switches a technology which appeared in the 20's Coal City went dial in 1939, but Morris a much larger CO was a Manual office, and a Toll center until 1959. When I started as a Lineman in 1965 all of the exchanges still had 4 and 8 party lines in the rural areas the 4 party lines were Full Selective Ringing (the phone only rang when it was for you) the 8's were Semi-selective Ringing you had to know your code (either 2 short rings or 1 standard ring) to know if the call was for you or the ""bridged party"".

64,MI,MI tchell 5,Milwaukee (south side),Wisconsin,USA,"These submissions are memory-drawn. We did not have a telephone (or a television, for that matter) until the late 1950s. When we left the farm, it was for Milwaukee, where you could pinpoint the area in which someone lived by his or her telephone exchange. The South Side was home to blue-collar Polish Catholic Democrat families, and featured EVergreen, ORchard, and MItchell telephone exchanges. EVergreen, to the best of my knowledge, was drawn from the many evergreen trees of the area. ORchard street was a residential street I'll tell her you came over."" Mitchell Street, by the way, was named for aviation hero General Billy Mitchell. And that's more than you wanted to know about the South Side, with its stoic, hardworking Polish people, and their neat gardens, and their trim, tight houses and their EVergreen, ORchard and MItchell exchanges, if they had telephones at all. Thanks for being interested. Will bookmark this site and follow your progress. Have already sent link to a friend in Baltimore.",msmuffet

66,MO,Mott Haven,"The Bronx, New York City",New York,USA,"Telephone exchange of childhood home. * * * * * * * * Mott Haven is mentioned in the first line of the song ""Black Cowboys"" by Bruce Springsteen (""Devils & Dust"" CD; 2005; ASCAP). * * * * * * * * Mott Haven, Bronx, New York (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia): Mott Haven is the southernmost neighborhood in the South Bronx. It refers to the area below 152nd Street, though relatively few locals actually refer to the neighborhood by its name, often preferring to identify Mott Haven by streets or refer to it simply as the ""South Bronx"". Mott Haven was the first neighborhood to give rise to the term ""South Bronx"". In the 1940s when the Bronx was usually divided into the East Bronx and West Bronx, a group of social workers identified a pocket of poverty in Mott Haven and called it the South Bronx. This pocket of poverty greatly expanded northward, reaching a peak in the 1970s when the North Bronx-South Bronx boundary reached Fordham Road. Today the North Bronx-South Bronx distinction remains more common than the traditional and perhaps more useful East Bronx-West Bronx distinction, and many still regard Fordham Road as the boundary. However, residents along Fordham Road imagine the South Bronx as some place further south. In November 1999, Scientific American noted: ""The Mott Haven section of New York City's South Bronx has long been one of the poorest neighborhoods in the nation. The median household income of its residents, most of whom are African-American or Hispanic, is less than one third of the U.S. median.""",vybxny

63,NE,Neptune,Lufkin,Texas,United States,"I am retired military and when I entered the U.S. Air Force in 1966, one of the things I had to do was obtain a Top Secret security clearance. The forms I filled out asked about previous addresses and phone numbers and the like. Over the years, I had to upgrade my security clearance data several times, so I began keeping a precise record of old addresses, phone numbers, etc. The following is some of the information I have been keeping. I'm not sure exactly when the transition occurred, but in the late 40's or early 50's, Lufkin, Texas switched over to dial service. Prior to that when you lifted the receiver, an operator would ask ""number please"". My phone number was 2384J and my grandmother's was 1006M. I think the J and M had to do with your position on a party line (several people shared the same number even though they had different telephone instruments -- If you picked up the receiver, and it was in use, you could hear and even talk to the people who were using the line -- although it was considered courteous not to do so.) After the transition, here is a list of phone numbers I have had and the locations and dates. Early 50's - Sep 1961 Lufkin, Texas  NEptune 4-7251 Sep 1961 - Jan 1965 Nacogdoches, Texas  LOgan 4-4930 Jan 1965 - Jan 1966 Nacogdoches, Texas  LOgan 9-9479 Mar 1966 - Mar 1966 Rantoul, Illinois (Chanute AFB)  892-8967 Oct 1966 - May 1967 Midwest City, Oklahoma (Tinker AFB)  PErshing 7-7345 Jun 1968 - Jun 1969 Overseas (no phone) Jun 1969 - Apr 1970 Del City, Oklahoma (Tinker AFB)  ORange 2-1831 Apr 1970 - Sep 1970 Rantoul, Illinois (Chanute AFB)",kaustin

This was an interesting central office. Origianlly the Scituate exchange back in the manual days, it was converted to a Step by Step switch (date unknown), and was converted to a digital office back in the early 1990's. Because this CO had a large calling area that included Providence, RI, rather than put in lots of extra equipment into the office (while it was still step by step) to dial all the Providence area exchanges, you had to dial ""8"" first, wait for the second dial tone (originally an old Crossbar #1 style Dial Tone - similar to Panel CO Dial tone, and later became an ESS or mor modern style dial tone) then you could dial the 7 digit number into Providence area exhcanges. While it was step, you could dail any other NIagra 7 number by dialing 7 plus the last 4 digits.",Ricciotti

66,No,norwood7,Norwood,ma,usa,"I was born in Norwood, MA in 1954. Up until 1960, Norwood did not have direct dial phone service. We had to pick up the phone, and an operator would say ""Number please?"" Then we would tell her what number we wanted to be connected to. Our phone number was Norwood 7 3978R. I've been told that that letter R on the end of the number indicated that we were on a two party line and not a private line. This is another aspect of these phone exchanges. Sometimes there were letters at the ends of phone numbers as well. Sometimes the letter was W or J or R. But when Norwood changed over to a direct dial system, unlike many communities, the Norwood 7 exchange went with it, and all of Norwood became 762, and the old Norwood 7 exchange became just a memory. Incidentally, it is my memory that I am going by to provide you with this information. In 1961 I moved to the next town, East Walpole, and I see that you do have the exchange for that town in your database.",samward54

653,OL,OLive,Smyrna,Delaware,USA,"In 1961, I was a nerdy little 5-year-old with thick eyeglasses and a goofy little bow-tie. I could not wait for school to start, and was already such a voracious reader that I had even read the slim blue and yellow phone book -- probably no more than about 30 pages -- of our tiny town of Smyrna Delaware, from cover to cover several times. My unexplainable appetite for ""reading the phone book"" stuck with me, and by the end of the first grade I could identify every state on the map -- solely from spending so many enjoyable hours memorizing that map of area codes found in the front of every phone book! This warped kid's love of phone numbers and phone books led him on to ""the hard stuff"" -- addresses -- right about the time that ZIP codes came into use in the early 1960's. By the time I graduated from high school, I was a full-fledged address junkie with a collection of Yellow Pages from all over the country. Things finally hit rock-bottom when I found myself becoming a full-fledged postal worker for several years -- and enjoying it. When I heard rumors about ZIP codes going to 9 digits, it was time to kick this habit, cold turkey, and go where the money was -- computer programming.

When we left the farm, it was for Milwaukee, where you could pinpoint the area in which someone lived by his or her telephone exchange. The South Side was home to blue-collar Polish Catholic Democrat families, and featured EVergreen, ORchard, and MItchell telephone exchanges. EVergreen, to the best of my knowledge, was drawn from the many evergreen trees of the area. ORchard street was a residential street I'll tell her you came over."" Mitchell Street, by the way, was named for aviation hero General Billy Mitchell. And that's more than you wanted to know about the South Side, with its stoic, hardworking Polish people, and their neat gardens, and their trim, tight houses and their EVergreen, ORchard and MItchell exchanges, if they had telephones at all.

Good, indicating that the painting should not be reproduced without permission of the artist. Then it listed the following ""ORegon5-1937"". I assumed it indicated the year that the painting was done, however, a friend of mine who was with me at the frame shoppe this past Saturday, pondered over it a bit and then the ""light bulb"" came on and he said, ""that's not a year, it's a phone number!"". He emailed me later to give me the link to this web site. Can you help? I'd love to find the artist or his family and tell them that I have this wonderful watercolor painting of a very southern scene.....which is why I bought the painting. Having grown up in south Georgia, where we have lots of country roads with old trees and rundown houses, the artist has captured a moment that reminds me of where I came from.

It must be because my parents were there for a long time and never bothered to say it differently. I had friends who had regular (7 digits) numbers, but I always said my number with the PI. Even in the phonebook, it was listed with the PI (it was almost the only one). It's weird when I think of my old number. I think of my old G.C. days. I moved from there 25 years ago.

And by some quirk in the system, we could substitute a 2 for the 8, so I could just dial 2-2456. When our calling area expanded to Provo, where 224-was an exchange, we had to dial all 7 numbers, and, because of that weird quirk, everyone whose number started with a 2 had to have it changed to 9.

(TAylor 9 and TUckerman 2 were also there, but you have already listed them.) Our 291 number was probably hooked up in 1963 when my parents bought the house, and my mother still has it.

73,RE,"RE gent 3, REgent 4",Appleton,Wisconsin,USA,"These submissions are memory-drawn. We did not have a telephone (or a television, for that matter) until the late 1950s. When we left the farm, it was for Milwaukee, where you could pinpoint the area in which someone lived by his or her telephone exchange. The South Side was home to blue-collar Polish Catholic Democrat families, and featured EVergreen, ORchard, and MItchell telephone exchanges. EVergreen, to the best of my knowledge, was drawn from the many evergreen trees of the area. ORchard street was a residential street I'll tell her you came over."" Mitchell Street, by the way, was named for aviation hero General Billy Mitchell. And that's more than you wanted to know about the South Side, with its stoic, hardworking Polish people, and their neat gardens, and their trim, tight houses and their EVergreen, ORchard and MItchell exchanges, if they had telephones at all. Thanks for being interested. Will bookmark this site and follow your progress. Have already sent link to a friend in Baltimore.",msmuffet

Our house was originally (get this!) the carriage house on her property, and she wanted a number that was easy for her to remember when she needed a carriage.

73,RE,REgent,Sunnyvale,California,USA,"Where do I begin? My interest in this subject was rekindled when I thought of buying my folks a restored vintage phone with their exchange and number printed on the label as a gift to replace the cheesy piece of crap phone they currently have. I only know this exchange name because my father asked someone for it at the phone company back when you could still talk to an actual live human face to face when you paid your bill. This would have been sometime in the late 1970's. He used to drive us all crazy because every time we were out shopping or running errands and somebody asked for our phone number, he would respond with RE-9, 3866. Or sometimes he would say Regent-9, etc. I nearly died laughing when I found this site, since this was a source of repeated angst for us kids (and Mom) when we got to witness the same scene over and over, the clerk looking up confused and not sure what to say, my father with a little innocent smile on his face. I'm sure he did it for shock value, but also out of nostalgia and because he hates letting go of things for which he has fond associations. I wonder how many teenage or twenty-something sales clerks got to hear his patented speech on the history of the telephone exchange, while the rest of the family gnawed their arm off in frustration after hearing it for the millionth time? Sometimes he would spring this on an old timer who looked momentarily startled but then grinned knowingly at my Dad before getting into a long conversation with him on the subject. His favorite moments were when he even got to lecture employees at the phone company itself, who predictably did not always understand what the heck he meant when he gave them his number with exchange. In fact I think he had the phone number printed that way on his checks too, and you can imagine the scenes this caused. When I think back now I realize its almost sad how my Dad's stubborn habit of giving the exchange gradually wore down over the decades until he stopped doing it entirely. Did we finally wear him down with our groans and protests, or had it gone from being retro to just irrelevant in the sea of endless numbers new technology? Now I'm sort of grateful for that quirk of his . . .how else would I know that the house where I grew up was(is) in the Regent-9 exchange? And how else would I be able to make a contribution here? My Dad may have given up on the exchange name, but more than 25 years later my folks still have the same number, and still don't have an answering machine or voicemail. And if the phone company hadn't come after deregulation and carted away the rotary wall phone installed in the kitchen the day we moved into that house, it would still be there too. -mountain kimmie RETURN THE MOJAVE DESERT PHONE BOOTH!",mountainkimmie

When the Red Bank central office was upgraded to a Class 3 toll office and a crossbar switch installed for the local service (In the late 1950's, I think), all the River Plaza lines were rerouted to the new CO. With the growth of the surrounding area in the 1970's, a new exchange 747 was added with the same first two digits, but to my knowledge the exchange letters were never applied to the 747 exchange.",doug.murphy

The first phone number I remember having was RO4-0393 (764-0393). I think it may have been a coincidence that 764 spelled out ROG, as in ROGers Park, because my mother always said our phone number was RO4-0393, not ROG-0393. I'm only 37, but maybe I remember it so well because my mother worked for Illinois Bell on Pratt Blvd., which was right across the street from our apartment at the time. My mother always had a lot of interesting information to tell us about the phone company when we were growing up. We used to occasionally visit one of the best telephone museums located in one of the Bell buildings downtown (maybe Franklin?), but I don't know if it's there anymore.

Originally SAInt George, it became SAint George 7 in December 1930 when New York Telephone went to the more familiar two-letter, five-number format (it was not made SAint George 4 because there was a Schuyler exchange on the upper west side of Manhattan). Until 1947 it served only the eastern North Shore of the island; in that year the eastern and western North Shore exchanges were combined and the exchange thus could be found anywhere on the North Shore, whose area included many neighborhoods in the island's mid-section as well. This situation changed in 1968, when two new exchanges - 698 and 761 - were assigned to the interior. As ""727,"" the exchange still exists on the island today.",generationx187

Not so--the geographical cutoff for the Saratoga exchange, apparently, is 22nd street. So, by moving one block up St. Paul street, I had to take a Chesapeake number instead!",grafonola

Being interested in anything involving the telephone, and a curious child in general, I asked her what it meant. She told me it stood for SKyline and explained how exchanges worked. Also, when we were in stores and my mother was asked for her phone number (probably for writing a check) I remember she would always say, ""S-K-4-8-1-0-3"". There used to be a Skyline swimming pool in Chicago Heights. After my mother explained exchanges to me, I asked my father if the exchange was named after the pool. He said the pool was named after the exchange. Neither one of my parents know why the Chicago Heights exchange was SKyline. My father said when he was a little boy, their phones didn't have a dial on them. He would pick up the phone and an operator asked for the number. He would say SKyline then only FOUR digits. When he started using phones with a dial was when he remembers using SKyline and five digits. He said they ran out of phone numbers when more people got private lines (instead of a party line) so that's why the switch was made from four digits to five.",apriljoy8

We only needed to dial 6-5171 in town (though you could dial the 75). There were two exchanges SK6 and SK3. In the late 1990's Cortland added a third exchange: 758. Interestingly, the next town over (Homer, NY) had an exchange of 749 (but I don't recall the exchange name).

The phone number was SUnset3-3311 or sunset triple three double one (almost as melodic as PEnnsylvanian 6-5000). One time when there was a leak in the phone cables for our area our phone would begin ringing every night at 7pm sharp and we would get constant wrong numbers non-stop tapering off around 10pm at night Finally on the third night of complaining, the Manitoba Telephone System repair listened in on our number and realized there was a problem. They were able to deal with it over the next 24 hours in terms of our service, but it ended up with having to dig up a number of blocks of Portage Avenue (the city's major thoroghfare) to replace conduit and cable which had been affected. The other dilemma we had was that any child who could reach the phone and dialed a number of ones, seemed to end up connecting with us. We had a lot of very weird conversations with 2 and 3 year olds.",pbest1

88,TU,TUlip,Mt. Pleasant,South Carolina,USA,"I must have been about ten years old in this childhood scene. I remember several grades at a time of my grammar school being assembled in the auditorium to be introduced to the new way of dialing. Most of us had a phone number on a shared party line before this, and you could pick up your phone and hear a conversation in progress between a neighbor and a stranger. (Of course, they could hear you, too, so you always quickly hung up the phone.) I think the gentleman who explained the new system must have had children, because he gave a good presentation that kept us all in- terested, and there were lots of questions from the kids afterwards. I was curious why TULIP was the word that our exchange was derived from, since our area of the country was/is well-known for other flowers, like azaleas, magnolias, dogwood or Carolina jessamine. (I don't think I grasped right away that the word wasn't supposed to be symbolic of the town!) We had to repeat a dummy phone number with the new exchange aloud as a learning exercise at the end of the assembly, and I have never forgotten the distinctive voice of a teacher behind me saying ""Tyew-lip four, oh nine oh nine"" over and over again.

86,UN,UNion,Springfield,Missouri,USA,"my own late '60s memories of my family's telephone number. I know a little about exchanges-it's funny, for something that was so prevalent when I was a kid (1960s-1970s), they are a complete mystery to anyone born after about 1970. They were phased out by the Bell system starting about 1962-I'm not sure why. They are certainly easier to remember than all numeric phone numbers. In England and France I believe that the first three letters of the word were used for the exchange. Thus in London you would dial WHItehall 6500, not WHitehall-6500 as in the US. Also, in many American cities, my own home of San Francisco included, telephone numbers were six digits until after World War II. I believe that San Francisco switched to seven digit numbers in 1947. Therefore, in 1946 a telephone number here might have been GRaystone-6500, in 1947 it would have become something like GRaystone 4-6500. I lived in Chicago during the 1970s and 80s and there were many exchanges still in use in common conversation and on commercials. A carpet company used HUdson 3-2700 in all of its TV ads, and another used NAtional 2-9000. These ads were still aired constantly at least until the late 1980s.

You could tell from your exchange whether you lived in Old Riverdale (so uncool!) or the newer part of town filled with bungalows built for WWII GIs. Old Riverdale was VI9, while the Ivanhoe section of town, and most of nearby Dolton, was VI1. Thinking about the exchange reminds me that those were the days of big old black phones that sat on their own tables. When my dad announced that we were going to the phone company--the only place to buy phones--to pick out a new model, I was so excited. I thought I could talk my dad into a pink princess phone. No such luck. We ended up with avocado green, one of the three colors of the Apocalypse.

92,WA,WAlnut,Benton Harbor,Michigan,U.S.A.,"Can't remember for sure when the WAlnut was removed from the phone book. Seems like the same time this occurred, was when we had to start using ""92"", which we did not have to use when calling inside the exchange, ie: dial 52775 within the exchange for 925-2775. That was our phone number for 2242 Fair Plain Avenue, Benton Harbor, MI. This reminded me of the front page story, in the News Palladium, of a woman who had a deed for property in Fair Plain (suburb of Benton Harbor) which described why Fair Plain was two words, not one as was so (un)popularly used by a vast majority of ""ostriches"" roaming the Fair Plain. The Indians (cannot remember which tribe) had determined the lay of the land and fertile soil resulted in a plain that was ""fair"" for living. The rest of the story is quite cloudy in my fading memory. Our deed was written as Fair Plain, but did not elaborate on the separation of the word(s). I always took a lot of guff for being so ""backward"" and ""out-of-touch"" when I insisted on using two words, instead of the accepted (corrupted) single word. After all, there was too much invested in signage, contracts, stationery, etc. to change it back to the original (correct!) spelling. I always conjectured one day someone was too lazy to write it out as two words and somehow it continued. It just struck me; it could have been someone wrote it as two words, but did not make the ""P"" noticeably larger than the lower case letters and connected, or overlapped, the ""r"" and ""P"". The city across the Saint Joseph River, was, strangely enough, Saint (St.) Joseph. Their exchange was YUkon (98). I'll check and see if that one has been entered in your data base. If not, I'll enter it properly. Due to your ""overload"" of ""incoming"" (data, not projectiles!), I don't expect a reply. Want to thank you for the opportunity to flash-back to the past and ""feel my roots"" again. It does a body good. Thanks for saving some of our culture's history. Hope you get a lot of good input; along with the attendant history lessons! There should be a good book brewing here; at least an insightful web page, many pages deep. Peace!

For many years one did not have to dial the first two numbers locally. As the population increased so did the need to dial all the numbers. I can't remember what my telephone number was when I was a very young child, but my Aunt & Uncle lived in Wallis, TX and their number was 34J. This was WAY before direct dialing.

All the numbers in Altoona began with ""94"" and my grandmother lived in NYC, so she had an exchange (TEmpleton). I knew all phone numbers had exchanges at the time, and this anwered the question what was Altoona's exchange. The sign was there for years - it's probably still there.

948,WI8,WIndsor 8,Gaithersburg,MD,USA,"This is a Gaithersburg exchange, although, today, it is listed as Rockville in the local phone books. WA6 and WI8 were the direct-dial replacements of the old manual Gaithersburg exchange. If you wanted local service, you got a 926 number. If you wanted Metro service (ability to dial entire DC Metro region), you got a 948 number. Therefore, if your old number was Gaithersburg 854, your new number was either WA6-0854 or WI8-0854. Other up-county areas have similar exchanges. It's confusing, because the phone company identified (still does) the exchanges by the pricing zone, rather than the physical location, so later, there were other Gaithersburg-metro exchanges used in other parts of upper Montgomery County (428, for example) that weren't really Gaithersburg. It still works this way today. Internally, these are still coded as Gaithersburg phone numbers, but publicly (phone book) they are listed otherwise, because of the pricing structure. For a while in the 60s and 70s, the Gaithersburg metro numbers were called ""Gaithersburg/Rockville"" exchanges, to distinguish them from either Gaithersburg (local) or true Rockville exchanges. Now Verizon simply lists all of the metro exchanges as Rockville, because these exchanges are priced as Rockville exchanges used ""out of area"" - you pay extra to have a Rockville number to be able to call Virginia & PG County without incurring long distance charges.",steinm

The earlier of the two has WOodbury 62800 (no hyphen) as the phone number, the later, BRadshaw 2-2800 (with hyphen). WOodbury was one of few 2L-5N exchanges in the late 1940s / early 1950s in LA, when most exchanges were 2L-4N. (MOrningside 1 in Los Feliz / East Hollywood / Silver Lake was another early 2L-5N exchange and, like WOodbury 6, it disappeared early.) By the mid-1950s, all 2L-4N had given way to 2L-5N.",voyager

96,WO,WOodland,Byron,GA,USA,"Old directories - early prefixes in Byron were ""WOodland 3"" (963). The Byron exchange was owned by the Byron Telephone Company. Byron became toll free from Macon in 1957, and the WOodland 3 prefix was in use then. During the early 60's, the Centreville office was cut into service, with the ""953"" prefix. At that time, numbers in Byron changed to ""956"" numbers, which were written in the all number format. Byron Telephone Company was later acquired by Mid Continent, which merged with Allied Telephone in 1983 to form Alltel. The former Mid Continent properties in Georgia were all merged into one company known as ""Alltel Georgia"". In mid 2005, Alltel still operates the exchange, along with many others in Georgia.",c_o_historian

96,WO,WOodland,Westmont,Illinois,USA,"Just my two cents' worth... Hi! This is a really neat project! My husband's grandmother has an exchange, too. She lives in Chicago, and has been in her house for nearly 80 years. Her exchange is BR8, although I can't remember what the BR stands for. The exchange Ive submitted, above, was the exchange for our next-door neighbors, from the late 1950s until 1986, when they moved away. I couldn't even begin to think of their home number in terms of actual numbers; I still, to this day, remember it as WOodland 8-9050. I have no idea whether or not our own telephone number at that time, which began with 971, had an exchange. We never used it, if it existed, so I suppose that our number was just that, a number. *sigh* And I know that exchanges were used on TV. On ""I Love Lucy"", for example, Lucy gave her phone number using an exchange. Unfortunately, I can't think of it at the moment, but I remember her doing so. I'm sure that you can find this on plenty of old television shows. (Nick at Nite/TV Land to the rescue, perhaps? ;) ) Just an observation... Thanks for the memories! Teresa :)",polyglot1

982,YU,YUkon,Odessa,WA,USA,"The Odessa, WA exchange was converted from a Magneto exchange to Dial around 1952. 4-digit numbers were assigned to this exchange. In the mid-1960's, the numbering plan was changed to 7-digits. The original EXchange name was to be YUkon, however, that name was being used in the Benge, WA exchange not far away. In order to avoid confusion, Pacific Northwest Bell opted to assign Odessa one of the first ALC (All Number Calling) NXX codes in the state, which was 982. Initially, Odessa was not a DDD dialable point because the Toll Center (Operator Services Center) serving Odessa was Ritzville, which still had Manual (non-dial) service. When the Ritzville exchange was converted to dial operation in the mid-1960's, Odessa then became a DDD dialable point. Since then, an additional NXX code of 988 has been added to the Odessa Rate Center and is used for Wireless (Cellular) service provided by AT&T Wireless.",KWeber

68,MU,MULberry,Baltimore,MD,USA,"This was one of two original dial exchanges in downtown Baltimore (SARatoga was the other) that were installed in the early 1920s. They were located in a long, narrow building at 5 Light Street which was recently demolished and is now a parking lot- typical Baltimore.... The switching equipment was ""Panel"", which had been introduced in Omaha in 1921. It was the first successful dial switching system used in America with store-and-forward capability (the ""sender"") where the selectors were not under direct control of the subscriber's dial, and therefore it had enough capacity to serve large cities. The Panel system continued to serve this office until 1984 or so, when these exchanges were cut to an ESS machine. To see pictures of Panel equipment, visit www.centralofficeonline.com and to hear what it sounded like, visit www.phonetrips.com . The main Baltimore Gas & Electric Company call center was served out of this Panel office- it was, and still is, MULberry 0123. In 1940 or so, C&P Telephone built a new central office on Saint Paul Place, a few blocks north of the Light Street office. This had the later #1 Crossbar switching, with the VErnon-7, PLaza-2 (originally SOUth), LExington-9 and other exchanges.

The operator would come on and say, ""Number please."" and I connected with my buddies. It was easy to remember my best friend's phone number. The last two digits of mine were 34. His were 35.As 1966 approached, we had the option of dialing the number direct on our rotary phone, or asking the operator to connect the call for us. Evidently tired of kids with lazy fingers, one opertor told me to dial the number myslef. This seemed unfair, because I was holding a popsicle in my other hand and couldn't dial. Prior to Barrington's expansion, businesses in the 1940s had a single digit telephopne number. Some years ago, I walked into a local landscaping business to buy a Christams tree. The son of the gentleman who statred the business wore a carpenter's apron from the 1940s. The phone number printed on the apron was 9. Things were simpler then. Math was easier.",John Mc

Few of these exchanges used all 9 available numbers for the 3rd digit, but densely populated Royal Oak did. But with a twist: for some reason, the exchange name for LI 1 thru 8 was LIncoln (Lincoln Ave., running east-west 1/2 mile south of the center of the township, and probably the site of the phone exchange building), but LI 9 was LIberty 9, and LI9 numbers were assigned exclusively in the northern part of the township.

However because it was an new addition to the system we had to have a 'party-line' for I think 6 months. After 1967 and along with the continued growth of the Lawton/Ft.

37,ES,Esher,Esher,Surrey,England,Esher exchange till the 1950s was a small manual exchange. Then it was combined with Claygate and based in Claygate. The code from London at that point was ES4 + 4 digits. Then it went 5 digits locally starting with 6. The code from London was ES then 6XXXX. The long distance code was 0ES2. Before long distance dialling from Esher to London was 97+XXX-XXXX and afterwards 01-XXX-XXXX. After dialling 97 there was a second dial tone if one waited - which was not necessary. My hunch is that 97 took the call to the automatic equipment in the KINgston exchange in the London area because a number of 9X codes went to KINgston (trial and error as a kid). In the early 90s the numbering went to 6 digits 46XXXX and today there are many prefixes other than 46. Around 1970 the ES(6) code from London changed to 78 (6) - I believe the ES(6) prefix 376 got used for a London area exchange as they were running out of numbers and for some reason they wanted to group exhanges around their numbers. Some years ago short prefixes from London to outer London exchanges were abolished and the national code 0ES2 had to be used. The letters were actually abandoned in the 60s so the code became 0372. In the 90s this became 01372.,Peter Nyholm

Later Olympic was split with a new Central Office build in Montclair community of Oakland and many were moved to 339. The move to all-numeric dialing in the 1950s led to a group called the Anti-Digit Dialing (club?) which tried hard to keep such famious San Francisco exchange names like YUkon.

2,A,Anthony,Fort Wayne,IN,USA,"I am amazed that there is still much confusion about CO codes in this city. Not to brag, but I've lived here all my life (60yrs) and worked as a COE installer for GTE....So here goes. Went to dial in 1926 with Anthony and Eastbrook downtown and Harrison on the southside. You dialed the first letter of the office name plus 4 digits for private lines or 5 digits if a party line. For example...A-3039 or A-21234. When other exchanges were added you dialed the first letter of the exchange name and 4 digits-private or party line. These exchanges were Kenmore (south), Trinity (north), Sherwood (Waynedale) and Windsor (New Haven). When we went to All Number Calling in 1963 the first letter was changed to its numerical equivalent and the digits 74 were stuck on the front. So A-3039 became 742-3039 and H-41234 became 744-41234 which of course makes for 8 digits...one too many, therefore they dropped the 7 on the front and it became 444-1234. This confusion only occured in the original three offices that had a letter and 5 digit party-line numbers. Thanks for letting me go on about this (but what the hey, there is already 4 pages of this and we didn't even have 100,000 people in 1963).",GreggG

We had a party line with four families all using the same line, and when you picked up the phone and got conversation, you were supposed to hang up quietly and wait until the other party was finished. Once in about 1953 when my baby sister cut her foot on a broken milk bottle, my mother asked me to pick up the telephone and call for emergency services. (She was busy stopping the blood.) The lady on our party line didn't believe me and told me to hang up and stop playing pranks. My mother had to come to the phone with her bleeding toddler in tow and tell the lady off.",Mary Elizabeth
443,GI,Gibson,New London,Connecticut,USA,"The Gibson telephone exchange covered all of New London, Connecticut. There were about 30,000 people in that city in the nineteen fifties and sixties when I lived there. We had a party line with two families on it, and we were only supposed to use the phone for emergencies or important calls, such as getting the homework assignment from a classmate. The other woman on the party line, however, used to call her daughter every day and talk for an hour before work (7-8 AM) and after work (6-7 PM). When we got home from school and our mother was still at work, my older sister and I used to get on the two extensions adn make prank calls to people who had famous last names. For example, several times we called a Mrs. Cassidy and asked to speak to Hopalong. Mrs. Cassidy sounded quite old to us, and she had a great sense of humor. She would say, ""I'm sorry, he's out back feeding the horses,"" or ""He's busy tying lassos. Can I take a message?"" Of course, the only message was a series of giggles.",Mary Elizabeth

Since we lived in a different exchange, there was a toll call, and after giving my aunts the news, such as that Grandpa was doing well, had no pain, and was beginning to take short walks, my mother would say to them, ""This is getting expensive for you, let's hang up now."" Then they would ask to speak to their nieces and continue talking to us for a half hour while my mother rolled her eyes and said, ""What a waste!"" We loved those calls, though.",Mary Elizabeth

Almon Strowger was issued a patent on the first workable automatic exchange in 1891 and the first one was installed in LaPorte, Indiana in 1892. Numerous improvements over the next decade made it viable for small and medium size exchanges. The Strowger switch had one major flaw, it could not provide large trunk groups for calls to other exchanges in large cities. The Panel switch alleviated this problem. The first one was cutover in the ATlantic office in 1921. The second one in N.Y. city's PENnsylvania office in 1922 beginning the change from manual to dial service in America's largest city.",Gregg G

However, it could NOT call the W.Warwick/ Coventry/Exeter (VAlley EXpress) Zone toll-free. This is odd because this zone was geographically closer than the other central office areas, but it had to do with switching and tandem requirements and the need for the US Navy base at Quonset to have access to the Providence dial area.
